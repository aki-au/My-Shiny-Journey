This App performs T-test.

T-test is a hypothesis test used in inferential statistics to find out if there is a difference between the means of the 2 groups. Here, the in-built dataset PlantGrowth has been used to compare the yield, measured by dried plant weight between different groups: Control, Treatment 1, and Treatment 2.
