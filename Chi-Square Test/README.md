This App performs Chi=Square test.

The Chi-Square test of Independance is a hypothesis test used in inferential statistics to find out if there is any relationship between different parameters. Here, the in-built dataset ToothGrowth has been used. For this test, the growth, i.e, size increase as well as other parameters have been tabulated to see their relationship. In this test, Null Hypothesis is the hypothesis which assumes independance.
