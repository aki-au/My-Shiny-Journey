This is a shiny app which performs F-test.

F-test is a hypothesis test used in inferential statistics to find out if the ratio between the variances of two populations is 1. Here, the in-built dataset iris has been used. For this test, only Sepal Width has been taken into consideration since its distribution is roughly normal.
